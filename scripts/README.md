## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start everything
./scripts/start.sh

# Check status
./scripts/status.sh

# Stop everything
./scripts/stop.sh
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Clean start (removes all dependencies and reinstalls)
./scripts/clean.sh
./scripts/start.sh

# Check if services are running
./scripts/status.sh

# Stop services when done
./scripts/stop.sh
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check what's running
./scripts/status.sh

# Force stop everything
./scripts/stop.sh

# Clean and restart
./scripts/clean.sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

## Log Files

When services are running, logs are created in the `logs/` directory:

- `logs/server.log` - API server logs
- `logs/client.log` - React development server logs
- `logs/server.pid` - Server process ID
- `logs/client.pid` - Client process ID

## Ports Used

- **3000** - API Server (Notes API)
- **8080** - React Client (Development Server)

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm
- Bash shell
- `lsof` command (for port checking)

## Notes

- Scripts must be run from the project root directory
- All scripts include colored output for better readability
- Services run in the background and continue after script exit
- Use `Ctrl+C` to exit the start script (services keep running)
- Logs are automatically created and managed
